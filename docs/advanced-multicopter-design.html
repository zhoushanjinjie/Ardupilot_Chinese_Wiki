<h2>There are several popular frame layouts for MultiCopters<a class="headerlink" href="#there-are-several-popular-frame-layouts-for-multicopters" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The Tricopter uses 3 motor / propeller propulsion units with a servo
to rotate one of them to compensate for adverse yaw.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Tricopters were popular early on when the brushless motor /
propeller units were new and scarce.</p></li>
<li><p>They suffer from less than stellar performance and do not scale
well to larger sizes.</p></li>
<li><p>But they still have some popularity for small, light hobby use
applications.</p></li>
<li><p>Because this is primarily an outdated design we will not expand
further on it in this article.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="../_images/tricopter.jpg"><img alt="../_images/tricopter.jpg" src="../_images/tricopter.jpg" /></a>
<ul>
<li><p>The very popular Quadcopter has 4 motor/propeller units and is
available in any size.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A Quadcopter is an elegantly simple design and is hands down the
most popular layout for a whole lot of reasons.</p></li>
<li><p>Quadcopters are symmetrical and embody the simplest principle of
operation for controlling roll, pitch, yaw and motion.</p></li>
<li><p>Simply varying the speed of each of the motors provides full 3D
motion and rotation and hover capability.</p></li>
<li><p>They are relatively inexpensive to produce and they scale well to
production manufacturing techniques.</p></li>
<li><p>In various sizes and layouts they are capable of actually
performing useful tasks beyond simply flying around.</p></li>
<li><p>Their primary drawback is that a single motor failure generally
results in an abrupt descent to the ground (crash).</p></li>
<li><p>A very wide variety of materials and techniques can be employed to
produce a useful Quadcopter.</p></li>
<li><p>There are several popular configurations for QuadCopters:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>X with and X frame arm layout and the front and back of the
copter between 2 propellers.</p></li>
<li><p>and with the same kind of X frame layout as above but with the
front and back of the copter in line with one of the
propellers.</p></li>
<li><p>“Dead Cat” a variation on X which in which the frame arms are
further apart in the front and the back than they are side to
side.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Name actually comes from Bart Jansen a Dutch artist who
stuffed his expired cat and made a Quadcopter out of it.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>H which has frame side arms running between the motors on each
side and connected with one or more frame arms in the middle.</p></li>
<li><p>Square which has frame arms connecting between motors (and
usually intermediate frame arms supporting a central frame.)</p></li>
<li><p>And variations including ones with the motors laid out on a
circle.</p></li>
<li><p>Most of them primarily operate the same as the X frame
(provides better camera exposure between motors among other
things).</p></li>
<li><p>I recommend the standard X frame design because it is strong
and simple and its natural symmetry balances flying forces
better.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>A humming bird sized <a class="reference external" href="http://www.estesrockets.com/helis-quads/quadcopters/004606-proto-x">Estes Proto X</a>
is shown below.</p>

propellers, 8KG lifting capability and claimed 60 minute flight

</li>
<li><p>For professional use, HexaCopters and OctoCopters with 6 and 8
Motor/propeller propulsion units are popular.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Hexacopters, Octocopters, Hex Y’s and Octo X’s can provide stable
heavy lift platforms good for photography and other uses.</p></li>
<li><p>Hex and Octocopters may have the benefit of potentially being able
to continue to fly with a single motor failure.</p></li>
<li><p>However the increased complexity versus a Quadcopter makes them
more failure prone.</p></li>
<li><p>The reduction in prop size and increase in prop speed result in a
smoother flight than an equivalent large blade Quadcopter.</p></li>
<li><p>However it also results in some reduction in flight efficiency and
endurance all other things being equal.</p></li>
</ul>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="../_images/hexacopter.jpg"><img alt="../_images/hexacopter.jpg" src="../_images/hexacopter.jpg" /></a>
</li>
<li><p>Hex Y6 and Octo X8 designs with pairs of coaxial motor/propeller
units mounted back to back are also becoming popular.</p></li>
<li><p>Singlecopters and Coax copters are very new designs and have some
advantages in specific applications.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Since they tend to a single ducted body for either the one or two
motor/propeller units they tend to be self protected indoors.</p></li>
<li><p>The coax copter which relies on variable thrust on each of its 2
props for rotation is functionally simpler than the single copter.</p></li>
<li><p>The side profile of the ducted body makes these copters more
susceptible to winds outdoors requiring more effort to compensate.</p></li>
<li><p>While generally good at hovering and fine positioning, they are
more speed and performance limited than other multicopter designs.</p></li>
<li><p>The Singlecopter in particular is reasonably adaptable to gasoline
engines for much greater endurance.</p></li>
<li><p>The possibility of using a single large propeller implies that
good efficiencies could be realized even with an electric
versions.</p></li>
<li><p>The Singlecopter features a single motor/propeller unit with 4
servo controlled vanes to direct roll, pitch and yaw.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="../_images/vtolcustom2.jpg"><img alt="../_images/vtolcustom2.jpg" src="../_images/vtolcustom2.jpg" /></a>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The Coaxcopter has dual motor/propeller units for thrust and yaw
control and 2 servo controlled vanes for roll and  pitch.</p></li>
</ul>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="../_images/mav_electric.jpg"><img alt="../_images/mav_electric.jpg" src="../_images/mav_electric.jpg" /></a>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>There are also variable pitch Multicopters for incredible acrobatic
performance.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Variable pitch multicopters have some interesting potential uses as well like the
<a class="reference external" href="http://curtisyoungblood.com/V2/products/quadcopters/stingray-500">Curtis Youngblood Stingray 500</a> shown below.</p></li>
<li><p>Servo control of the props (rotors) produces roll, pitch and yaw
so they are often powered by a single motor with shaft or belt
drive.</p></li>
<li><p>If you use a single motor it is feasible to use a gasoline engine
giving you the potential for considerable endurance and range.</p></li>
<li><p>These are very high performance and can even fly inverted, they
are also mechanically more complex but can be built robustly.</p></li>

<h2>Motors, propellers and ESCs<a class="headerlink" href="#motors-propellers-and-escs" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>For multicopters, motors, propellers and ESCs (speed controllers) are
critical and have been failure prone in the past.</p>
<p>This ECalc based <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ecalc.ch/xcoptercalc.php?ecalc&amp;lang=en">Xcopter: motor - propeller - battery - ESC calculator</a> will
help you pick the best components for your copter.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Quadcopter design will be used for illustration as they are the most
wide spread and the most versatile.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>But the information applies equally to Hex and Octo designs,
either conventional or coaxial Y and X types.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The brushless out-runner motors have to support the full weight of
the copter continuously while turning at high speed.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hobby grade motors have often used inadequate Conrad type unsealed
bearings which are good axially but not in thrust.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>And the motors are usually open frame to permit the greatest
cooling but providing little or no protection</p></li>
<li><p>This has meant an unnecessarily high failure rate and very poor
survival in wet or dusty conditions.</p></li>
<li><p>The cheapest possible Chinese motor is never a good choice for
something that literally hangs in the air by its motor.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Some of the best motors have 2 or better 3 easily replaceable
ABEC-7 bearings, RCTiger-Motor Pro series and KDE for instance.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The best motors are well ventilated, made with high temperature
components and coated and sealed for environmental protection.</p></li>
<li><p>The best motors like TMotor and KDE have performance comparison
charts, these should be reviewed when designing a copter</p></li>
<li><p>You are best off selecting motor - prop - battery cell
combinations that will provide 10% or higher G/W efficiency at
50% throttle.</p></li>
<li><p>You should also target you copter design weight so that it
hovers at approximately 50% throttle for optimum efficiency and
flight time.</p></li>
<li><p>Top motors can cost considerably more, but reliability,
performance and efficiency can be much better and worth it in
the long run.</p></li>
<li><p>Low KV motors running on lower voltage (fewer cells) with large
propellers are the most efficient and provide the longest
flight times.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Selecting the best motor, propeller, battery set will enable you
to build a copter with a usable 30 minute flight time including a
camera.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You can get 30 minutes from 330 copters with 8” props to 700
size copters with 18” props depending on camera / gimbal
weight.</p></li>
<li><p>It is very hard to get much more than 30 minutes of usable
flight time from any “useful” multicopter regardless of size.</p></li>
<li><p>For hobby grade components, 20 minute maximum flight times
would be a more realistic goal.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>ESCs are also very important.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>High quality ESCs are more reliable than cheap ones.</p></li>
<li><p>And ESCs need to be properly sized to ensure they can provide the
maximum current that is necessary.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Generally use the right size not over sized because they are
more efficient if operated in the appropriate range (and
lighter).</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Sufficient cooling is also very important especially for “Heavy
Lift” copters, and the ESCs may need to be placed in the air
stream.</p></li>
<li><p>For small to medium QuadCopters there are four in one ESCs in the
20 - 30 Amp size range with several advantages.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>They eliminate the need for a power distribution plate or block
and all the attendant wiring.</p></li>
<li><p>The considerable reduction in DC wiring results in less DC EMF
radiation interference with the compass.</p></li>
<li><p>They can often be conveniently installed tidily in the center
of the copter frame.</p></li>
<li><p>The 20 and 25 amp ones work with 3 or 4 cell LiPo batteries and
the 30 amp one works with 3 to 6 cell batteries.</p></li>
<li><p>They have a built in aluminum heat sink plate on one side
(which you can augment with a finned heat sink if necessary).</p></li>
<li><p>You can use a thin layer of Fujik silicone thermal glue to
attach a finned heat sink if one is needed.</p></li>
<li><p>They generally have higher reliability than individual ESCs and
are reasonably priced.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Larger diameter slower turning propellers are normally a lot more
efficient than smaller, faster ones.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>But there are limits and drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Trying to turn too large a prop for a given motor can cause it
to overheat so motors usually have a maximum prop size.</p></li>
<li><p>Also, really large, slow props can reduce the responsiveness of
the multicopter and even cause it to oscillate in the air or
vibrate.</p></li>
<li><p>Unless taken to extremes these difficulties are not usually
significant and can be compensated for by various means.</p></li>
<li><p>And you can always drop the diameter an inch if the handling
characteristics or motor stress are not what you want.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>There are also different designs of propellers and for larger ones
turning at slower speeds design is especially critical.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Carbon fiber designs with cupped blades that are wider at the
hub and narrower at the tip are best for larger sizes 14” and
over.</p></li>
<li><p>Smaller ones in the 14” and under category can be of more
conventional design with a wider than normal blade and of
plastic or CF.</p></li>
<li><p>Often motors are “charted” with specific propellers and these
are certainly the best starting point for optimum performance.</p></li>
<li><p>TMotor is considered a premium prop, but good results have been
obtained with RC-Timer and Tarot in the large tapered props.</p></li>
<li><p>APC, DJI, GemFan, RC Drones and Graupner all produce good props
in the 14” and under category.</p></li>
</ul>

<li><p>Every component and manufacturing technique was clearly optimized to produce the best possible motor without compromise.</p></li>
<li><p>This motor has a finned heat-sink case and a self ventilated design with high temperature encapsulated components.</p></li>
<li><p>In fact it is designed to run, if necessary, continuously at temperatures that would instantly destroy most other motors.</p></li>
<li><p>It is reasonable to expect that various configurations could provide well over an hour of useful operating time with cameras.</p></li>
<li><p>It is feasible to produce a QuadCopter that will approach the performance of the $15,000.00 Steadidrone at a fraction of the cost.</p></li>
<li><p>A similar practical lifting capability and nearly 40 minute useful flight times should be achievable even with 18” Propellers.</p></li>
<li><p>And given the extreme over design and ruggedness of the motors, similar reliability and longevity could also be expected.</p></li>
<li><p>This is the motor I will be using in my next Quadcopter and I will allow for up to 18” propellers.</p></li>

<h2>The MultiCopter Frame<a class="headerlink" href="#the-multicopter-frame" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are many types of frames and it is most important to put together a frame that is appropriate for your use.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>There are a lot of Multicopter frame types and many are available as bare frame kits or Almost Ready To Fly or Ready To Fly copters.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Most professional grade Multicopters are made from fiberglass and carbon fiber cut tubing and plate.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Carbon fiber is very strong, but is also brittle and can
shatter on impact, it is also hard to machine and to glue to.</p></li>
<li><p>Fiberglass weighs a bit more for equivalent strength but is
more shatter resistant and easier to machine and glue to.</p></li>
<li><p>Fiberglass or carbon fiber tube and sheet construction are very
suitable to use for making your own copters.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Many consumer grade Multicopters are made with injection molded
plastic parts and aluminum tubing.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Some injection molded parts can be very durable (the Iris’s
Zytel frame arms for instance), but others are cheap and break
easily.</p></li>
<li><p>Square aluminum tubing frame arms are common, but they tend to
bend or break with annoying frequency in normal mishaps.</p></li>
<li><p>Except in specialized welded H or box frames aluminum tubing
frame arms are sub optimal and will not be covered in depth
here.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Some of the newer, smaller, commercially made Quadcopters have
monolithic injection molded plastic shells.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>On smaller copters these shells can be quite durable but they
would be too fragile on larger ones even if mold costs were
justified.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>A few Quadcopters have monolithic shells made from vacuum formed
laminated Kydex or other plastic sheet</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Vacuum formed shells of laminated Kydex have proven very
durable on small copters and are very good for waterproof uses.</p></li>
<li><p>At least one vacuum formed copter has been made with built in
blade guards the Safe Flight 4410 (unfortunately out of
business).</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Hand laid fiberglass or carbon fiber is also popular on high end
quadcopters.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There are some very attractive, hard to get and not inexpensive
hand laid fiberglass and carbon fiber shells made by “DeX”.</p></li>
<li><p>There are also a variety of fiberglass shells for civilian,
commercial and military use including an amphibious one.</p></li>
<li><p>Fiberglass shells tend to be expensive and may get damaged in
use and can be difficult to repair.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Each type of construction has advantages and disadvantages and it
is very important to figure out what is important for your needs.</p></li>
<li><p>Prop to prop and prop to frame clearance limit the max diameter of
your propeller blades.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Allowing for various prop diameters will let you tune the
copter for its current weight, batteries and function..</p></li>
<li><p>Generally allow an additional half inch of clearance from prop
tip to tip or to center frame to avoid asymmetrical prop wash
vibration.</p></li>
<li><p>A major design criteria is to size the frame appropriately for
the largest propellers you might ever want to use.</p></li>
<li><p>Generally bigger propeller diameter equals better efficiency
and an X frame layout normally permits the largest possible
props.</p></li>
<li><p>Of course the motor speed and power and frame strength have to
be matched to the propeller diameter and to total lifting
capacity.</p></li>
<li><p>Pancake Low KV, Low RPM motors can turn bigger propellers
efficiently.</p></li>
<li><p>It is possible to overlap prop tips if you have one above the
other, but it does affect efficiency and induces asymmetric
vibration.</p></li>
<li><p>Big slow props can have adverse vibration, instability, gust
compensation and response rate issues also so that is a
downside.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The additional motors of Hex and Octocopters can permit single
motor out recovery and provide for smoother flight for photo uses.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>But they need to use smaller propellers because of motor to
motor clearance which is less efficient resulting in shorter
flight times.</p></li>
<li><p>There is also additional cost and weight of the frames and
extra motors and propellers.</p></li>
<li><p>And, the overall increase in complexity also reduces
reliability.</p></li>
<li><p>High quality extended service larger pancake motors and props
are just starting to become available.</p></li>
<li><p>So we are likely to see a shift to large Quadcopters from
Hexacopters and Octocopters even for professional and
commercial uses.</p></li>

<h3>The Carbon Fiber or Fiberglass Tube and Plate Frame<a class="headerlink" href="#the-carbon-fiber-or-fiberglass-tube-and-plate-frame" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The carbon fiber or fiberglass tube and plate frame is popular because
it is strong and light and easily manufactured.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.helipal.com/tarot-fy650-quadricopter-frame-set.html">Tarot 650</a>
is a typical layout medium sized carbon fiber Quadcopter frame that
can work with up to 17” propellers.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It features folding arms and landing gear.</p></li>
<li><p>Its ability to support pancake motors and 17” props means it can
provide long flight times.</p></li>
<li><p>Some people have said the quality of construction is not as good
as it could be but for $125.00 it is an amazing bargain.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="../_images/T2eC16hwFIZrQuFnzBSVOZPjKoQ60_3.jpg"><img alt="../_images/T2eC16hwFIZrQuFnzBSVOZPjKoQ60_3.jpg" src="../_images/T2eC16hwFIZrQuFnzBSVOZPjKoQ60_3.jpg" /></a>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Fabrication requirements and techniques for fiberglass and carbon
fiber tube and plate copters.</p></li>
<li><p>On the copters shown above the method of attachment is by clamping
carbon fiber tube frame arms with aluminum brackets.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is because of the difficulties in attaching carbon fiber
parts as well as the stress that can result from drilling the
tubing.</p></li>
<li><p>Fiberglass is not quite as strong or light as carbon fiber but it
is more flexible and easier to join and machine.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>If what you need is available in a commercial frame kit you are
normally better off buying it as you will spend more making your own.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It will also take a lot of time and effort to design the copter,
to obtain the components and to, cut, drill, machine and fabricate
them.</p></li>
<li><p>There is also a strong possibility that design and fabrication
mistakes and misperceptions will require that some things get
redone.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>If you have sufficient reason to make your own frame, tube and plate
construction is generally the most practical for home production.</p></li>
<li><p>It is reasonable to mix materials, commonly carbon fiber frame tubes
and fiberglass central and motor mounting plates.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Carbon fiber and fiberglass tubing and plate can be cut with a
hacksaw or power jig or band saw (with metal or fiberglass
blades).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It can also be drilled and milled with HSS or TC coated drills
and mills, but all tooling wears out very quickly cutting these
materials.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Carbon fiber in particular is tricky to cut, drill and machine, it
can tear, shatter or de-laminate if not done smoothly and slowly.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A drill press is mandatory for carbon fiber, you cant center
punch a pilot drill hole, so it needs to be held precisely in
place.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid milling of carbon fiber if at all possible, it is very
difficult to accomplish satisfactory results.</p></li>
<li><p>You will see carbon fiber plates that have milled slots on
consumer copters but these have generally been cut with a water
jet.</p></li>
<li><p>With carbon fiber you will generally get better results
drilling precision placed holes rather than attempting to mill
slots in it.</p></li>
<li><p>You can carefully and slowly cut a carbon fiber plates exterior
edges with a power saw and smooth them with a Dremel tool.</p></li>
<li><p>If you must put in slots consider drilling a hole at each end
and using a small circular saw on a Dremel or flex shaft to
connect them.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>It will be necessary to provide appropriate brackets to clamp
the motor mounts and central hub to the frame arm tubes.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Tubing needs to be clamped but must not be “crushed”, silicone or
rubber gasket can provide protection and vibration isolation.</p></li>
<li><p>Hardware should be aluminum or stainless steel machine screws and
you can use Nylok nuts or “Blue” Loctite on regular nuts.</p></li>
<li><p>Plate separation and mounting can be provided with Nylon or
aluminum standoffs.</p></li>
<li><p>(Note: It would be really nice if somebody made an X internal
slip-glue fit ferrule for the center of the frame tubes but they
don’t - yet!)</p></li>

<li><p>Although this is specialized and requires a vacuum forming “press” it
may be justified for some applications.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A vacuum molding press can be made relatively inexpensively that
can make whole small shell type frames or for components.</p></li>
<li><p>Copters made this way can be made weather tight and even water
proof and they can be incredibly tough.</p></li>

monocoque shell when molded properly.</p></li>

<h2>Specific Building Examples and Techinques<a class="headerlink" href="#specific-building-examples-and-techinques" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Some design considerations for a medium large, high efficiency, heavy
lift Quadcopter build.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A simple, rugged and very versatile X Quadcopter with a frame
sized large enough to accept 18” diameter propellers might
include:</p></li>
<li><p>High quality 20mm carbon fiber tube frame arms with SteadiDrone
motor mounts and central frame tube clamps from EBay or China.</p></li>
<li><p>Cut and drilled carbon fiber or fiberglass top and bottom central
frame plates mounted to the tube clamps and standoffs.</p></li>
<li><p>A custom or commercial off the shelf landing gear system.</p></li>
<li><p>An optimal Pro configuration might include the top rated
$120.00 KDE 4014XF-380KF motors and a 30 amp 3 - 6 cell  four in
one ESC.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The motors and ESC would cost about $540.00 and you would get a
copter tuneable to lift up to 20+ pounds in total weight.</p></li>
<li><p>It is reasonable to get this configuration to achieve usable 60
minute flight times even with photo or video equipment aboard.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>A more conservative hobby configuration might include the $40.00
SunnySky X4108S 380KV motors and a 25 amp four in one ESC.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The motors and ESC would cost about $200.00 and you would get a
copter tuneable to lift up to 10+ pounds in total weight.</p></li>
<li><p>Even with this setup you could achieve usable flight times in
excess of 30 minutes with small to medium consumer size
cameras.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Some additional features that need to be considered are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A third frame plate under the two frame tube sandwiching plates
can accommodate the batteries, ESCs and Receiver.</p></li>
<li><p>A vacuum formed, fabricated or adapted top and bottom shell can
weatherproof the copter and increase its resistance to mishaps.</p></li>
<li><p>This frame is less than 27” from corner to corner, but props can
be removed for transport or folding arms could be incorporated.</p></li>
<li><p>This frame will be very light and strong and it will allow lots of
latitude in how it is set up and it will be easy to upgrade.</p></li>
<li><p>Its ability to accept larger props even with an inexpensive power
system will provide much better than average flight times.</p></li>
<li><p>The copters capabilities will be according to the power system
selected, the battery combination used and the total weight.</p></li>
<li><p>You can include a camera gimbal under the center plate, make sure
the landing gear does not interfere with the cameras view.</p></li>
<li><p>The landing gear should minimize interference with prop wash and
provide strong, resilient and stable support.</p></li>
<li><p>If you really are determined to build your own frame, this is a
really good place to start.</p></li>

<h3>A Small Quadcopter Optimised to Use High Efficiency Lithium Batteries<a class="headerlink" href="#a-small-quadcopter-optimised-to-use-high-efficiency-lithium-batteries" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Modern ultra efficient Lithium batteries can have nearly twice the
energy per unit weight of the LiPo batteries we normally use.</p></li>
<li><p>3300 mah 3.7volt Panasonic NCR18650B batteries weigh 47 grams versus
a normal LiPo equivalent of about 100 grams per cell.</p></li>
<li><p>Their disadvantage is that their maximum discharge rate is only 2C so
6.6 Amps.</p></li>
<li><p>They will also last for many times the number of charge discharge
cycles of our normal LiPos.</p></li>
<li><p>Used properly a copter using these batteries can get nearly twice the
flight time of one with the same weight of LiPo batteries.</p></li>
<li><p>The most important factor in designing a copter to use these
batteries is to keep the weight low enough that their is sufficient
current.</p></li>
<li><p>This quadcopter design uses carefully selected T-Motor MT2206 1200 KV
30 gram motors and 10” props with a light carbon fiber frame.</p></li>
<li><p>It includes a 2S 2P 6600mah lithium battery, autopilot,
receiver and even an FPV camera and transmitter.</p></li>
<li><p>It weighs about a pound and since the battery is 2 parallel it can
provide 13.2 amps of current (max current is less than 10 amps.)</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.ecalc.ch/xcoptercalc.php?ecalc">Xcalc computations</a>
show that a hover time of 60 minutes might be possible with a
realistic fly around time of about 30 minutes.</p></li>
</ul>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="../_images/Quad10X1.jpg"><img alt="../_images/Quad10X1.jpg" src="../_images/Quad10X1.jpg" /></a>

exceptional capabilities and double the normal flight time.</p>

<h2>A Commercial MultiCopter Exhibiting Advanced Design Concepts<a class="headerlink" href="#a-commercial-multicopter-exhibiting-advanced-design-concepts" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Here is an example of an excellent QuadCopter design: the Aeryon
SkyRanger for high end UAV applications.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="../_images/Aeryon_SkyRanger2.jpg"><img alt="../_images/Aeryon_SkyRanger2.jpg" src="../_images/Aeryon_SkyRanger2.jpg" /></a>
<p>This copter has a lot of things right and is really a study in good
design and quality construction.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The rotating ball full enclosure camera Gimbal provides good weather
protection and improved performance.</p></li>
<li><p>The motors are on the bottom under the arms.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>More aerodynamically efficient with no prop wash interference and
very little intake interference.</p></li>
<li><p>Noticeably increased flight times, greater lift capability and
quieter as well.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>High torque, low KV “pancake” style motors and slow turning, large
diameter, high efficiency props.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>This is much more efficient than faster motors with smaller
diameter conventional design props.</p></li>
<li><p>This also increases flight times and load capacity and reduces the
sound footprint.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Tapered carbon fiber frame arms are more aerodynamically efficient
and are light and very strong.</p></li>
<li><p>The fully enclosed weather tight framework with snap latch type
access makes maintaining the copter easy.</p></li>
<li><p>A simple spring loaded landing gear provides for uneven landing sites
and minimal interference with the prop wash.</p></li>
</ol>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="../_images/Skyranger.jpg"><img alt="../_images/Skyranger.jpg" src="../_images/Skyranger.jpg" /></a>
<p>This QuadCopter incorporates several excellent design concepts and shows
what can be done without budget constraints.</p>
<p>The Skyranger has features we can use in our own designs but it is
important to understand all designs are compromises.</p>
<p>The 3DRobotics Iris is one of the best designed QuadCopters that you can
actually get and it is a real bargain.</p>

<h2>Conclusion and Additional Design Considerations<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion-and-additional-design-considerations" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I have not covered either 3D printing or CNC machining.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>These are both perfectly valid techniques for either whole frames
or for parts or accessories.</p></li>
<li><p>But most people do not have the equipment or capability which is
why they are not covered here.</p></li>
<li><p>Clearly if you have either of these capabilities they can greatly
enhance your copter projects.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>I have also not covered in depth hand laid fiberglass or carbon fiber
or vacuum bagging.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You can make Dynamite frames or shells this way but this too
requires serious individual skill  and capability (especially
carbon fiber).</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>I have also not gone into detail about the engineering criteria for
multicopters:</p>
<ul>
<li><ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li><p>I don’t know.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><ol class="upperalpha simple" start="2">
<li><p>From what I’ve seen very few people do.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>C. One who does is Paul Pounds PHD and here is his Paper on the
subject: <a class="reference external" href="http://eprints.qut.edu.au/33833/1/33833.pdf">Quadrotors</a></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>If you stick to a simple design and try to keep frame arm to a simple
single small tube under the prop wash it will work fine.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Round tubing has about half the flat plate area (prop wash
interference) as the same sized square tubing.</p></li>
<li><p>You can improve efficiency by putting the motor prop under the
frame arm but then there are frame design and clearance issues.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Try to keep the weight centralized as much as possible and keep the
autopilot near the horizontal center if possible.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>So that the copter tends to roll and pitch as though pivoting
around the center of mass and around the autopilot.</p></li>
<li><p>However it is not as critical as some people have made it out to
be because the stabilizing throttles will automatically
compensate.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>You can do a lot with a rudimentary understanding of the forces
involved, if you need more it is a career, not a hobby.</p></li>
