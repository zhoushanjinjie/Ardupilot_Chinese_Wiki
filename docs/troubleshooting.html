<p>This can be due to a number of mistakes:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Have you completed the mandatory hardware configuration steps
described
<a class="reference internal" href="configuring-hardware.html#configuring-hardware"><span class="std std-ref">here</span></a>?</p></li>
<li><p>Are you in Acro, Stabilize or Simple mode? As a safety measure, the
motors won’t arm in other modes.</p></li>
<li><p>Are you using the APM 2.5 Power Module to power the APM board, as
recommended? If not, and you’re using one of your ESCs via the PDB to
power the board, make sure the JP1 jumper is on.</p></li>
<li><p>Are you sure you’re arming them right? When the motors are armed, the
arm LED (green on APM1, yellow on APM 2) on the IMU will turn solid
after the IMU calibration flashing (about 5 seconds). Review
the <a class="reference internal" href="arming_the_motors.html#arming-the-motors"><span class="std std-ref">arming guide</span></a> to
make sure you’re doing it right.</p></li>
<li><p>Are your Yaw or Throttle channels reversed on your transmitter? Try
moving the Yaw stick to the far left, instead of the right. If that
works (green LED tuns solid after the IMU calibration, your Yaw is
reversed. If not, try the same with the Throttle channel: push it to
max and try full right yaw from there. If that works, your Throttle
channel is reversed.</p></li>
<li><p>Is your RC gear in Mode 2? If not, you’ll need to move the right
stick (yaw) to the right and the left stick (throttle) to the top.
(Or just switch back to Mode 2)</p></li>
<li><p>Some ESCs are thrown off by some startup signals in Copter 2.x. Try
plugging in a USB cable first, to boot the board, and then plug in
your LiPo after it’s already up, or just ensure that the four-wire
cable from your APM board to your power distribution board is
disconnected during regular startup.
See details <a class="reference external" href="https://diydrones.com/profiles/blogs/apm2-esc-startup-problem-and-workaround">here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s possible you’ve changed your throttle trim settings since you
did your initial radio calibration. Trim the throttle down a few
notches and try arming again.</p></li>
<li><p>Some ESCs have a minimum low threshold before they will arm. If you
need to, trim down your radio throttle and redo radio calibration.</p></li>
<li><p>Redo your radio calibration in the Mission Planner. Make sure that
the throttle channel (Ch 3) is being read properly and the values are
around 1100 (low) and 1900 (high), more or less. Remember that your
LiPo must be plugged in to power the RC gear.</p></li>
<li><p>If you’ve checked the previous things, it may be that you need to
recalibrate your ESCs. Do it the manual way
(<a class="reference internal" href="esc-calibration.html#esc-calibration"><span class="std std-ref">here</span></a> to be sure).</p></li>

<section id="my-apm-2-is-locking-up">
<h2>My APM 2 is locking up<a class="headerlink" href="#my-apm-2-is-locking-up" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The cause is probably that the dataflash card not initializing
correctly. To verify this is the problem, take it out and try to power
your apm 2 again.</p>
<p>If this is the case, there is an easy fix. Put the dataflash back in,
and power the board up while looking at the terminal screen. It will
reformat the card (this will take A WHILE). Leave it plugged in for 2
min. After that you should see a “ready to fly” message. You only have
to do this once.</p>

<p>This almost always means that you’ve configured it or set it up wrong.
Check the following:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Is the APM board facing forward and in the direction of forward
motion (towards the forward arm in + mode and between the arms in x
mode)?</p></li>
<li><p>Have you set your quad orientation right in the setup process: + or
x?</p></li>
<li><p>Check that all the motors are hooked up right, turning the right way
and the pusher/puller props are on the right motors and oriented the
right way.</p></li>
<li><p>Check the signal wires on the power distribution board to make sure
they are oriented correctly. If you’ve reversed two, it will cause
Copter to flip. This should be noticeable by doing the hand test as
well. (It should have also shown up in the Motors test above)</p></li>
<li><p>Check that your props can’t turn on their motor shafts, as if they
weren’t tightened down enough. If one can, despite its prop being
tightened, that may mean that its motor shaft has been pushed down
into the motor too far for the prop mount to get a grip. Take off the
prop and and use a small allen wrench to loosen the little set screw
that holds the shaft onto the motor. Then with pliers pull the shaft
out until it’s the same height as those of the other motors. Then
tighten the set screw, and put the prop back and tighten it up again.</p></li>
<li><p>Was the quad stable and flat for the whole calibration routine at
startup? Was it stable and flat during the setup process? (If need
be, do it again)</p></li>
<li><p>Did you calibrate your ESCs? They should all start together when you
advance the throttle. If need be, do it again manually, as described
<a class="reference internal" href="esc-calibration.html#esc-calibration"><span class="std std-ref">here</span></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Did you setup and test your radio? Run test/radio to see. Pitch,
Roll, Throttle and Yaw should all be 0 or near zero (60 or less).
Move the pitch and roll stick to the lower right, you should see
approximately 4500, 4500 in Channels 1 and 2.</p></li>
<li><p>Have you checked all your sensors in the Mission Planner to make sure
the hardware is working right?</p></li>

<h2>My overpowered copter rockets into the air can’t be brought down unless I cut the throttle<a class="headerlink" href="#my-overpowered-copter-rockets-into-the-air-can-t-be-brought-down-unless-i-cut-the-throttle" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Very over powered multicopters can require so little throttle to hover
that even the minimum throttle (13%) is enough for them climb. In
addition, the default Rate roll/pitch gains, which are meant for weaker
copter, are too high for a powerful copter and can lead to roll/pitch
instability. The Copter firmware may try to compensate for this
roll/pitch instability by increasing the overall throttle which can lead
to the copter climbing further (Note: in this particular case Copter
increasing the overall throttle is counter-productive but in a properly
tuned quad it helps in cases where there is a motor failure).</p>
<p>The possible solutions are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>add extra weight to your frame to bring the hover throttle closer to
mid stick</p></li>
<li><p>reduce the THR_MIN parameter (default is 130 or 13%) to the lowest
value that will still keep all motors spinning reliably</p></li>
<li><p>set the rate roll/pitch gains low (perhaps 1/2 the default) during
the first flight and increase them from there. Consider using the CH6
tuning feature to allow you to tune your roll/pitch gains for the
first few flights.</p></li>

<p>While there are a few different reasons for copters to be perceived as
underpowered, this condition applies to motors that simply aren’t
spinning fast enough (if at all!) to generate the lift needed, even
though you know they can spin faster.  Some instances discovered
recently showed someone had accidentally imported the wrong parameter
file into their copter from the 3D Robotics Aero, and when they then
loaded the correct parameter file, the THR_MAX parameter was left
unchanged.</p>
<p>Check the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Connect to the copter via your GCS</p></li>
<li><p>Go to Full Parameter List</p></li>
<li><p>Examine the THR_MAX parameter and make sure the value is between 800
and 1000.  The default is 1000.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>FYI: The 3D Robotics Aero preset param file sets this to 80.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>If the THR_MAX parameter is less than 800 and you don’t recall
making this change, set the parameter to 1000 and Write Params out to
the copter</p></li>

<h2>My radio setup isn’t reading the RC channels right or hangs<a class="headerlink" href="#my-radio-setup-isn-t-reading-the-rc-channels-right-or-hangs" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Check the following:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Click on that Calibrate Radio button. That will start the measurement
process.</p></li>
<li><p>Are you sure your receiver is getting power and is paired with your
transmitter (it should show a solid green light). Make sure your
transmitter is on!</p></li>
<li><p>If you assembled the board yourself, double-check your soldering! A
tiny short on the APM board could disable all the channels.</p></li>
<li><p>We’ve had some reports of problems with older FM RC gear and even the
occasional digital receiver, for reasons that are not clear (most
likely low voltage output). Can you try a different receiver? This at
least will eliminate that possibility.</p></li>
<li><p>We’ve also had reports of people having trouble with Spektrum radios,
which have a funky binding process. This is what works: To bind the
receiver and telemetry (TM1000+AR8000 to DX8) module, connect them
both together(TM1000 to AR8000). With the transmitter off (DX8 off),
press the tiny button on the side of the telemetry module (TM1000)
and power the receiver (plug the LiPo batteries but do not plug the
4-wire connection). Both the receiver and telemetry module will start
to blink (if they do not blink TM1000 is no good). When that happens
turn on your radio holding the trainer/bind button and it will bind
(stay at least 10ft away). Make sure that when it binds it says
something like “binding dsmx —— receiver with telemetry”. You may
have to do this twice if it doesn’t pick up the telemetry module the
first time.</p></li>
<li><p>Check your cables! The signal wire should be at the top, and ground
at the bottom.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, if all else fails, try to narrow down the problem. First,
check that the receiver is working right by plugging a servo into
the output you’re testing and making sure that it’s outputting a good
signal. Then plug one known-good RC channel into the APM input
channels, from 1-7, one at a time and see if any are read. If some
channels are read and some are not, you may have a soldering error or
may have fried one or more inputs.</p></li>
<li><p>If you still can’t diagnose the problem, contact the customer support
from the store you bought it from.</p></li>

<p>Every copter is different, and even the official kit can have
differences in motor performance or balance depending on how you’ve put
it together. So we’ve made it relatively easy to tweak many of the
performance settings to turn your copter perfectly. That said, tuning is
something of an art, so it helps to read a bit more before you start
tweaking.</p>

<p>Make sure the CG (center of gravity) of the copter is dead center. Then
run the level command on a flat surface. (hold disarm for ~15 seconds to
invoke.) You can also fly in auto-trim mode in a windless (important!)
environment–any wind will cause the changes you make to work against
you when the quad rotates 180°. Hold arm for ~ 20 seconds to fly in
auto-trim mode for about 45 seconds. It will exit auto-trim
automatically and fly normally. (Don’t worry about counting out the
time, just wait for the flashing lights to enter either mode.</p>
<p>You <strong>can</strong> use your radio pitch and roll trims, but remember to
re-center them when you set up your radio with the config tools. I’m not
a fan of trimming the radio for quads, but NEVER, NEVER trim yaw. (Quads
are also susceptible to drafts. They will need constant correction
unless you install an optical flow sensor. One day…)</p>

<section id="the-quad-always-wants-to-yaw-to-the-right-or-left-when-i-take-off">
<h2>The quad always wants to yaw to the right or left when I take off<a class="headerlink" href="#the-quad-always-wants-to-yaw-to-the-right-or-left-when-i-take-off" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>This is usually due to an airframe that it out of tune, either with one
motor tilted slightly or the weight balance not centered. Typically, the
bad behavior is that the quad will always yaw by a certain amount,
typically around 30-45 degrees on takeoff, but will stay in that
direction. This is because the mechanical asymmetry of an out-of-tune
quad is forcing the yaw, and the limit is just how long it take for the
P term in the AC2’s PID equations to grow and stop it.</p>
<p>Although you can adjust those terms in the Mission Planner’s PID
configuration screen, the best solution is to solve it at the source.
Eyeball each motor and see if it or the arm it is one is slightly
tilted, and bend it back to vertical if so. Also ensure that the battery
is centered on the quad and the center of gravity of the vehicle is as
close to the center of the APM board as possible. It’s also a great idea
to redo the ESC calibration routine just in case.</p>
<p>Also make sure that you’ve got your forward-rotating and
counter-rotating props on the right motors, as
shown <a class="reference internal" href="connect-escs-and-motors.html#connect-escs-and-motors-attach-propellers"><span class="std std-ref">here</span></a>.</p>

<p>Your compass may need calibrating. AC2 calibrates while flying to take
the magnetic fields of your motors into account. You must disarm the
motors at the end of your flight to save your calibration to EEPROM. It
usually takes 1-2 flights before the calibration makes a difference.</p>
<p>You must use a compass in conjunction with a GPS. If you disable your
compass, please disconnect your GPS or you will have random Yaw hold
issue.</p>

<p>The most likely cause of this is your bullet connectors. After your
initial setup, when you test motor direction and electrical connections,
we<strong>strongly</strong> recommend that you cut off the bullet connectors and
directly solder the motors wires to the ESC wires. That way is
vibration-proof and will lead to much more reliable operation.</p>
<p>If your wires are soldered without bullet connectors and you still see
this issue, there are some other things that can cause this problem.
Your motor may be going bad: either the bearings are going or your shaft
is horribly bent. A motor with bad bearings takes more power to spin. In
that situation, the ESC could be cutting out to protect itself. Or it
maybe flying slow enough to stall the motor. Attach a current sensor
between your battery and the motor and test the difference between a
good motor and the bad one. If you are seeing higher draw in the bad
one, replace or fix it.</p>
<p>Another possible cause is the THR_MIN parameter’s default of 130 is too
low for your motors or ESCs. The THR_MIN parameter controls the minimum
throttle that will be sent to the ESCs/motors to ensure they keep
spinning while your throttle is above zero. If this parameter is too low
it is possible for your motors to momentarily stop leading to a twitch.
Try increasing this parameter to 150. You should be careful not to set
this parameter too high (i.e. &gt;150 especially on a high powered copter).</p>

<h2>One of my motors started shaking and then burned out!<a class="headerlink" href="#one-of-my-motors-started-shaking-and-then-burned-out" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Motors will typically twitch once per second or so (often with a beep)
while they’re waiting for a signal. That’s normal. But sometimes, if you
have not followed the warnings and disconnected the four-wire signal
cable, they may vibrate rapidly when you reset your board. This is a
rare problem that can crop up with certain ESC types that don’t handle
out-of-range signals well (it’s a problem with the Arduino bootloader
during bootup, so there’s not much we can do about it). But it can
always be avoided by following the advice of this warning, which is
liberally sprinkled throughout the manual!</p>

<h2>The APM board works when it’s plugged into the USB, but not when it’s powered by the RC rail (ESC/Lipo)<a class="headerlink" href="#the-apm-board-works-when-it-s-plugged-into-the-usb-but-not-when-it-s-powered-by-the-rc-rail-esc-lipo" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>APM allows for both RC power or a separate battery run through APM’s
built-in power regulator as
described <a class="reference internal" href="common-apm25-and-26-overview.html#common-apm25-and-26-overview"><span class="std std-ref">here</span></a>.
A solder jumper called SJ1 determines which is used. By default from the
factory, that jumper should be soldered which means APM will be powered
by the RC rail.</p>
<p>If for some reason, connecting power to the RC rail does not power your
board, check to see if that jumper is soldered. If it isn’t, as shown
below, just solder a blob of solder over the two pads to connect them.</p>

<h2>I’m using a MediaTek GPS, and although the module’s blue lock LED goes solid, APM is not showing a lock or I’m getting “No GPS” on the Mission Planner display<a class="headerlink" href="#i-m-using-a-mediatek-gps-and-although-the-module-s-blue-lock-led-goes-solid-apm-is-not-showing-a-lock-or-i-m-getting-no-gps-on-the-mission-planner-display" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>I’m also not getting GPS data in my telemetry.</p>
<p>Solution:</p>
<p>There are a few things that could cause this. First, make sure that your
input voltage to APM is not too high. It should be in the range
5-5.4v. <strong>Do not power the board at 6v.</strong></p>
<p>Second, ensure that you’ve selected the right MediaTek version in the
config file. If you bought your module from the DIY Drones store before
December, 2010, it had version 1.0 firmware: select GPS_PROTOCOL_MTK
in the config file. If you bought it after that, it as version 1.6
firmware: select GPS_PROTOCOL_MTK16 in the config file.</p>
<p>Finally, if things still aren’t working, check your cable. Cables longer
than the short one that ships with the GPS module tend to have thinner
wires that can break.</p>

<h2>I’m not getting GPS lock at all<a class="headerlink" href="#i-m-not-getting-gps-lock-at-all" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>First, note that you will probably only get GPS lock outside (if you’re
very near a window or are lucky enough to have strong GPS signal and a
radio-transparent roof, you may be able to get lock inside). For a cold
start (power on), it make take three minutes or more. If you’re just
hitting the reset button after lock has been achieved, it should take
less than a minute.</p>
<p>If you can’t get GPS lock outside after many minutes(the blue LED on the
MediaTek module keeps blinking), you may have a defective module. If the
module shows lock, but the red APM GPS LED is still blinking, you either
have a bad cable or an older MediaTek module that needs to have its
firmware updated.</p>
<p>If you have a uBlox module and APM is not showing lock, you may not have
ordered the module preprogrammed for ArduPilot from the DIY Drones store
(you had to select that option).
In that case, program it yourself with

<p>If you have a problems on getting your Copter up from the ground, check
that you propellers are mounted correct way.</p>
<p>Official Copter propellers are not symmetric and they need to be mounted
proper way. If you look close to center mounting hole, there are small
texts saying 10x45 or 12x45. There texts needs to be upside.</p>
<p>If text is on downside, your Copter cannot lift properly.</p>
<p>The props that came with early version of the 3D Robotics Copter were
also of uneven quality and some would flex too much under load, reducing
lift. If you have these (black and more flexible than most props), you
should replace them with APC or equivalent props or contact 3D Robotics
for a replacement.</p>

<h2>In Alt-Hold or loiter my copter is very bouncy or takes off into the sky<a class="headerlink" href="#in-alt-hold-or-loiter-my-copter-is-very-bouncy-or-takes-off-into-the-sky" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Copter uses the accelerometers heavily for calculating altitude and
climb rate. Vibrations from the motors can cause the accelerometer
values to become very noisy and throw off the altitude estimates. The
solution is to reduce sources of vibration from your frame (bent prop
adapters and motor shafts, replace EPP props with APC) and remove hard
connections between the frame and APM by using vibration dampening
products such as <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dubro.com/products/r-c-protective-foam-rubber">DuBro foam</a>.</p>
<p>As of version 2.9 of Copter, inertial navigation is used to maintain
altitude and in 2.9.2 horizontal position as well so vibration truly
needs to be minimized. A small pad (1/2 to 1”) of Kyosho Zeal tape under
each corner of the autopilot should get vibration low enough.</p>
<p>Or you can use a standoff with an extending screw 1/10” outboard of each
corner of the autopilot and suspend it with four 1/16”
O-rings of appropriate diameter such that when folded over through the
autopilot they just hold the board without movement, but also
not in much tension.</p>
<p>When a flight log is checked in RAW mode, X,Y and Z hovering ACCELs
vibration on a log graph should at least be in the + to - 5 range and
either of the above techniques can get them down to the plus to minus 1
range if they are just right.</p>
<p>You can graph your Z-axis vibrations by enabling the “RAW” message type
in the <a class="reference internal" href="common-downloading-and-analyzing-data-logs-in-mission-planner.html#common-downloading-and-analyzing-data-logs-in-mission-planner"><span class="std std-ref">dataflash</span></a>,
then take a short flight in Stabilize mode and finally download the logs
and graph them with the mission planner. Below is an example of an
extremely badly vibrating copter (top) and a nearly perfectly smooth
copter (bottom). The Z-axis vibrations should not move up and down more
than -5 to -15 or alt hold will not function correctly.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="../_images/BadVibrations1.png"><img alt="../_images/BadVibrations1.png" src="../_images/BadVibrations1.png" /></a>
<p>There is a good discussion <a class="reference external" href="https://diydrones.com/forum/topics/vibration-isolation-and-dampening-of-apm-px4-for-version-2-9">here</a> re vibration dampening.</p>

<p>The throttle deadband when in alt-hold or loiter mode is from 40% ~ 60%
of the throttle. If you have an overpowered or underpowered copter then
when in stabilize mode the throttle required to maintain a hover may be
outside this range. So when you engage alt-hold or loiter your throttle
is outside of the deadband and Copter thinks you want to climb or
descend. The simple solution is to move your throttle back to centre as
you engage alt-hold. A permanent solution is to modify the THR_MID
parameter through the mission planner’s Adv Parameter List screen. If
your copter hover at 40% of throttle stick when in stabilize mode, make
THR_MID = 400. If it hovers at 60% of throttle make the parameter 600,
etc.</p>

<h2>Mission planner displays enormous “Distance to Home” or “Dist to WP”<a class="headerlink" href="#mission-planner-displays-enormous-distance-to-home-or-dist-to-wp" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The “Dist to WP” (distance to waypoint) default to -1 when you do not
have a waypoint set. Because of a display issue the mission planner
displays this negative number as 65535. It will display a proper number
as soon as you enter loiter mode, guided more or start a mission. This
display issue will be fixed in a future version of Copter.</p>
<p>The “Distance to Home” is the distance from the mission planner’s home
location (which is different from the Copter’s home location which is
set when you arm the motors). You can reset the mission planner’s home
location to the copter’s current location by clicking on the “Home
Location” link in the Flight Planner screen. Below is a video
explanation and how resolve it.</p>

<p>You should not attempt to fly your copter in this state because
<a class="reference internal" href="altholdmode.html#altholdmode"><span class="std std-ref">AltHold</span></a> will not
function at all. You should instead go into the Mission Planner’s
Terminal screen and reset your parameters by typing “setup”, “reset”,
“Y” and rebooting your APM.</p>
<p>The cause is a bug in the 2.9.1 accelerometer calibration routine that
can save NaN to the AHRS AHRS Trim parameters if the calibration routine
fails. This feeds into the inertial navigation routines and results in
the bizarre altitude display in the mission planner. Note: you will
likely have seen “Calibration failed (????)” after you attempted to
calibrate the accelerometers values.</p>
