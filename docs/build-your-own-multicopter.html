<h2>There are Lots of Ways you Can Put Together a MultiCopter<a class="headerlink" href="#there-are-lots-of-ways-you-can-put-together-a-multicopter" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Thoughtful, slow progression is better than jumping in with both
feet, you can easily get discouraged by trying to do too much too
fast.</p></li>
<li><p>You are likely to have a good experience if you start with a simple,
small QuadCopter, either a Ready to Fly or an All Inclusive Kit.</p></li>
<li><p>For those with good DIY capabilities an Almost Ready To Fly build
like the F450 FlameWheel described below can also work well.</p></li>
<li><p>For your first MultiCopter, DO NOT initially try to build a Photo /
Video or First Person View copter, just build a good QuadCopter.</p></li>
<li><p>Even if you know that’s what you really want to do, it will take you
some time to come up to speed on our copters and autopilots.</p></li>
<li><p>If you just want to get a taste and have a lot of fun, try one of the
little inexpensive, safe, sturdy, ready to use Micro-QuadCopters
below.</p></li>
<li><p>If you know you’re serious, try the <strong>Flamewheel ARF Build</strong> or if
you just want to fly and can afford it get the high end <strong>Iris</strong>
QuadCopter.</p></li>
<li><p>The Iris includes a top end <strong>Pixhawk</strong> autopilot and both
the Iris and the Flamewheel can do <strong>FPV</strong> or <strong>Video</strong> when you are
ready.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t start with a <strong>Frame Up Build</strong> unless you have a complete
article on how to build a really good simple Quadcopter like the Flip
Sport.</p></li>
<li><p>Absolutely do not start by trying to <strong>Build Your Own Frame</strong>, even
among experienced builders there are more failures than successes.</p></li>
<li><p>It is very important to <strong>NOT</strong> start out with a big (dangerous)
multicopter with a bunch of photo or video stuff on it, you will
regret it.</p></li>
<li><p>A small, agile <strong>QuadCopter</strong> is always a lot more fun to fly than a
big, ponderous and slow <strong>Hex</strong> or <strong>OctoCopter</strong> in any case.</p></li>
<li><p>Except for top end professional HD video or photography requiring big
cameras you are always better off thinking small, light and agile.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>Safety is very important with multicopters, keep plenty of

<h2>Chinese Imports Good Deal / Bad Deal?<a class="headerlink" href="#chinese-imports-good-deal-bad-deal" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>It is very tempting especially when just starting out to buy lots of
Chinese direct import stuff because it is so much cheaper: Bad Idea!</p></li>
<li><p>As you gain experience, you will learn which import items are
serviceable, if you try to do it at the beginning things will not go
well.</p></li>
<li><p>I recommend you always get the main electronics (autopilot)
from the primary source, in our case the Pixhawk from 3DRobotics.</p></li>
<li><p>You will also want to get the electronic accessories (GPS,
magentometer, telemetry and OSD if used) from 3DRobotics as well.</p></li>
<li><p>If your going to do first person view, get a 3DRobotics FPV kit or a
FatShark Attitude video goggle and transmitter.</p></li>
<li><p>As for cameras, the GoPro Hero 3 and especially the Black is the one
to get, because it is what everybody uses and it works well.</p></li>
<li><p>The DJI Flamewheel ARF kit which is recommended is made in China but
is a known quality setup, so where you get it is up to you.</p></li>
<li><p>The Traxxas, Hubsan and Helimax highly recommended starter
micro-Quadcopters are also made in China but are still a great way to
start.</p></li>
<li><p>Motors, Batteries, ESCs, frames and even FRSky or Turnigy RC
transmitters and receivers can be very good deals direct from China.</p></li>
<li><p>A lot of items we buy domestically are actually made in China and of
course, quality varies widely, regardless of country of origin.</p></li>
<li><p>A $25.00 RC-Timer motor is not likely to be of the same quality as
the equivalent $100.00 Tiger-Motor, but hey, it’s only $25.00.</p></li>
<li><p>Although direct Chinese imports generally have pretty reliable
shipping, aftermarket support or returns are often very problematic.</p></li>
<li><p>If you build in a ten to twenty percent broken, damaged or not
included expectation for Chinese imports you will not be
disappointed.</p></li>
<li><p>In any case, start with two or three of the recommended “builds”
below so that you can experience success and learn to fly first.</p></li>

<p>If you are new to MultiCopters, I very strongly suggest you start
with one of these inexpensive Ready To Fly QuadCopters.</p>
</div>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>They come with everything you need including the radio and the

<h2>All Inclusive Kit<a class="headerlink" href="#all-inclusive-kit" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>#. The easiest way to build is to buy a single kit that has all the parts
necessary in one box and a set of instructions for each step.</p>
<p>#. Outside of (Ready To Fly) a good all inclusive kit is the most reliable
and straightforward way to construct a quality MultiCopter.</p>
<p>#. Usually all of the components are well balanced with each other and the
entire craft can be expected to perform well.</p>
<p>#. For an all inclusive kit, assembly is just nuts and bolts and possibly
some soldering.</p>
<p>#. The assembly procedure is usually well explained in the supplied
instructions.</p>
<p>#. The downside is that often quality kits are a bit more expensive than
other alternatives and customization has to be added on.</p>
<p>#. If you are not already well qualified at Do It Yourself projects, A good
all inclusive kit is definitely the best place to start.</p>
<p>#. The innovative <a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/3DRobotics-3DR0171-3DR-IRIS-Quadcopter/dp/B00NWXY076">Iris QuadCopter</a> is
actually <strong>Ready To Fly</strong> and comes with the top of the line
<strong>Pixhawk</strong> autopilot. However, these are no longer produced/sold by 3DR.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic">
<li><p>It is capable of fully autonomous flight and includes the RC
transmitter, the battery and even telemetry, at $750.00 it is a real

<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>If you need everything and want the most versatile copter possible
you can’t beat the Iris above, it is simply a great deal.</p></li>
<li><p>If you already have a RC transmitter you can save some money and
still build a really high quality autonomous QuadCopter.</p></li>
<li><p>Even if you are just starting there are a few really good choices.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The <strong>DJI F450 Flamewheel QuadCopter ARF Kit</strong> may well be single
the best choice at this time.</p></li>
<li><p>This kit comes with frame with built in power distribution board,
the 4 motors and the 4 Electronic Speed Controls and 8 Propellers.</p></li>
<li><p>You need to add a <a class="reference internal" href="common-pixhawk-overview.html#common-pixhawk-overview"><span class="std std-ref">Pixhawk</span></a> Flight
controller, A battery and your Radio Control Transmitter and
Receiver.</p></li>
<li><p>The supplied equipment in the kit is all first rate and the real
DJI Flamewheel frame is very stiff and sturdy (a good thing).</p></li>
<li><p>Cost: F450 ARF kit $180.00, Pixhawk with GPS/Compass $280.00 and a
Battery $35.00 = ($495.00) plus a PPM-Sum receiver.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>As an alternative, the smaller <strong>DJI F330 Flamewheel Quadcopter</strong> is
also an excellent choice and can be better in smaller spaces.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The <a class="reference internal" href="dji-f330-flamewheel.html#dji-f330-flamewheel"><span class="std std-ref">Wiki page on constructing the F330</span></a> is applicable to the <strong>F450</strong> as
well.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Most ARF kits that are cheaper than this are not nearly as sturdy and
the components generally fail much more frequently.</p></li>
<li><p>You can buy the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amainhobbies.com/product_info.php/cPath/2_382_2405_3233_3237/products_id/235232/n/DJI-Innovations-Flame-Wheel-F450-ARF-Quadcopter-Kit-w-Motors-ESC-Propellers">F450 ARF kit Here!</a> This

<li><p>DO NOT get a clone kit that looks like it, the real DJI motors and
ESCs are top quality and the frame is stiff and strong, the clones
are not.</p></li>
<li><p>There are more expensive high quality ARF kits available but the
FlameWheels will give great service and have very high performance.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to keep initial cost to a bare minimum, start with
a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__24723__Hobbyking_KK2_0_Multi_rotor_LCD_Flight_Control_Board.html">Simple Flight Controller</a> then

you are ready</p></li>
<li><p>The F450 can also serve as a competent Gopro and Gimbal carrying
photo and video copter or as an FPV platform.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>DJI F550 ARF Hexacopter</strong> is a good choice for more advanced
uses, but it is not ideal as a first MultiCopter.</p></li>

<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Once you get into building your own MultiCopter based on a frame kit
you are getting into the big leagues, this is really not for
beginners.</p></li>
<li><p>The exception is if you are carefully following a specific and highly
detailed build.</p></li>
<li><p>I am working on 2 Frame Kit based builds at the moment, a Flip 380
Sport QuadCopter and a Tarot 650 Carbon Fiber Quadcopter.</p></li>
<li><p>A little bit on the reasons for and methods used in each of the
Builds.</p></li>
<li><p>The Hoverthings <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hoverthings.com/the-flip-black">Flip 380 Sport</a> Frame is billed
as the most indestructible frame ever.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>It uses incredibly stiff and strong CNC machined 1/4” thick
Fiberglass arms and G10 Fiberglass center plates.</p></li>
<li><p>It can incorporate the same motors and ESCs as used in the DJI
Flamewheel and can use up to 10” propellers.</p></li>
<li><p>I purchased the Flip Sport Kit plus an extra pair of “tab” type
center sections and extra 7/8” spacers.</p></li>
<li><p>The extra center plates mount below the stock plates on 7/8”
spacers to accommodate the battery and flight gear.</p></li>
<li><p>I am using 4 of the stock DJI Flamewheel motors and a special <a class="reference external" href="http://mymobilemms.com/OFFTHEGRIDWATER.CA/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=2_4&amp;products_id=203">4 in 1 ESC</a> placed
between the center plates of the copter.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="../_images/3281_dimg2.jpg"><img alt="../_images/3281_dimg2.jpg" src="../_images/3281_dimg2.jpg" /></a>
</li>
<li><p>The 4 in 1 ESC produces much less RF and DC interference and is
neater than 4 ESCs and a power distribution board.</p></li>
<li><p>I am using <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rcdude.com/servlet/the-2498/GemFan-DJI-Hub-10x4.5/Detail">GemFan DJI hub compatible 10” carbon filled propellers</a> because
they are very tough and very efficient.</p></li>
<li><p>My goal is to build an even tougher and higher performance copter
than the DJI F450 Flamewheel - inexpensively.</p></li>
<li><p>Although it’s a small copter the Flip is powerful and agile enough
to use FPV video and/or a GoPro Camera and brushless gimbal.</p></li>
<li><p>Here is a link to the <a class="reference internal" href="hoverthings-flip-sport-quadcopter.html#hoverthings-flip-sport-quadcopter"><span class="std std-ref">Hoverthings Flip Sport Quadcopter Wiki Build Page</span></a> using a Pixhawk autopilot.</p>

a carbon fiber frame that is quite large for a QuadCopter and it can
incorporate up to 17” propellers.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>I am using 360kv slow speed, large diameter <strong>Pancake Motors</strong>
designed to turn the more efficient large propellers at low
speeds.</p></li>
<li><p>I will be using a variety of 14” to 17” propellers to explore
performance and efficiency at various propeller diameters.</p></li>
<li><p>Although the Flip Sport build shown above could be appropriate for
a first QuadCopter, this Tarot 650 build is definitely not.</p></li>
<li><p>This quad is big enough to serve as a heavy lift or long endurance
copter or to carry a big video or still camera, but:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>For lifting a 2KG payload with a quadcopter you need some
serious motor and some serious prop.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.rctigermotor.com/html/2013/Navigator_0910/38.html">Four Tigermotor MN4010 475 KV motors</a> at
$86.00 each, four 15 x 5 or 16 x 5 props and four high quality
30 amp ESCs.</p></li>
<li><p>It needs 10,000mah of 4 cell Lipo batteries (two 5000’s) to
achieve approximately ~10 minutes of flight time at 4KG total
weight.</p></li>
<li><p>It should be capable of lifting 4 KG total (including 2KG
payload) and leave about 50% reserve thrust (minimum
needed) (6kg total).</p></li>
<li><p>You will need 16” x 5  props to achieve the thrust and
efficiency necessary to lift 4KG total with reasonable flight
times.</p></li>
<li><p>That is why the bigger motors with the lower KV are required
and they need to be high quality to withstand continuous high
output.</p></li>
<li><p>It is very highly recommended that you do not attempt to
construct one of these for your first build.</p></li>

<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Although this is often attempted by those who have never used a
multicopter, it very seldom turns out well.</p></li>
<li><p>At the simplest level a functioning QuadCopter can be built out of
sticks or dowels and plywood that will fly.</p></li>
<li><p>But it is very unlikely to fly well or to be very serviceable or to
well tolerate less than perfect “landings”.</p></li>
<li><p>And this is no way to save money, RTF, Kits and ARF include high
quality matched components and actually cost less.</p></li>
<li><p>Even if you are an experienced model builder, machinist or engineer,
DO NOT START HERE!</p></li>
<li><p>Multicopters have their whole own set of flight dynamics and
structural demands.</p></li>
<li><p>Until you have become experienced with them you stand virtually no
chance of designing and making a worthwhile MultiCopter.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a really lovely QuadCopter design made by a newbie from bent
sheet aluminum on our site right now.</p></li>
<li><p>Unfortunately sheet aluminum is soft, the copter is heavy and hard
landings are common so a very bent copter is inevitable.</p></li>
<li><p>Even if you are very experienced, you will certainly need to make
several copters before you achieve a worthwhile design.</p></li>
<li><p>I won’t say Experts only, but you really need to go through at least
3 or 4 commercial MultiCopters before you even think about doing
this.</p></li>
<li><p>I have made over a dozen different CAD designs so far and have not
yet built one, I will make one, but I’m not ready yet and I know it.</p></li>

<h2>Brand Name Ready to Fly<a class="headerlink" href="#brand-name-ready-to-fly" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>A few words about the <strong>Brand Name</strong> Ready To Fly QuadCopters like the
<strong>Parrot</strong>, the <strong>DJI Phantom</strong> and the <strong>Blade 350QX</strong>.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Within the scope of their capabilities these are generally well made
and often a reasonable bargain for what they do.</p></li>
<li><p>But they are also not easily modified or improved on and are not easy
to upgrade to a more powerful autopilot like the Pixhawk.</p></li>
<li><p>So although they are a moderately capable one stop solution, they can
also be a bit of a costly dead end.</p></li>
<li><p>You can put together a <strong>Flamewheel ARF kit</strong> with a top end
<strong>Pixhawk autopilot</strong> for about the same money and be way
ahead.</p></li>

<h2>Which Approach is Right for You<a class="headerlink" href="#which-approach-is-right-for-you" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>It is very important to match your approach to your capability level,
if you overreach you can end up with a negative experience.</p></li>
<li><p>It is also much more important to take a robust and conservative
approach than to try to do everything the first time out.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The simplest approach is to get a <strong>Ready to Fly</strong> system or an
<strong>All Inclusive Kit</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>However, a good <strong>Almost Ready To Fly</strong> kit plus some carefully
chosen components can also result in an outstanding copter.</p></li>
<li><p>The ARF approach can often cost somewhat less and enable you to
construct a copter that is specifically tailored to your needs.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>Frame Kit</strong> approach presumes that you have sufficient
knowledge to specify appropriate components that will work
together.</p></li>
<li><p>But it does let you put together a copter that is specifically
optimized for your needs and desires.</p></li>
<li><p>Unless you find and scrupulously follow a comprehensive article
detailing a specific “build” a Frame Kit should not be your first
copter.</p></li>
<li><p>Clearly that goes double for <strong>Scratch Built</strong>. It isn’t actually
all that hard to build a MultiCopter frame.</p></li>
<li><p>But the overall process and component matching to make it work
well is really for the experienced MultiCopter operator / builder.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>There are expensive, high end Multicopters, which are generally
oriented to commercial photo or video use and outside our scope here.</p></li>
<li><p>All of the Copters I have and will be putting together incorporate
a <a class="reference internal" href="common-pixhawk-overview.html#common-pixhawk-overview"><span class="std std-ref">Pixhawk</span></a> autopilot</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>These are the best and most capable autopilots available
and they have great <strong>DIYDrones</strong> community support.</p></li>
<li><p>Beware of clones and counterfeits, they often have small
differences that end up making them completely unusable.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t say I didn’t warn you: “Caveat Emptor” and “You get what you
pay for”.</p>
