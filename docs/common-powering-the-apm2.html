<p>The APM2.x is end of life for use with ArduPilot.
This article is made available for existing users.</p>
</div>
<p>This article demonstrates the options for powering the APM2.x board
along with information about the requirements for connecting the power
rail.</p>
<section id="overview">
<h2>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Like any computer, the APM needs a power supply with a steady clean
voltage and sufficient current.</p>
<p>3DR provides an <a class="reference internal" href="common-3dr-power-module.html#common-3dr-power-module"><span class="std std-ref">3DR Power Module</span></a> that
supplies 2.25A at 5.37V. The module is designed to convert power from
the main flight battery (18 Volt maximum).  That module will supply
sufficient power for your APM, and low power radios including your RC
receiver (without servos). Your RC receiver can be powered from any APM
Input (+5V and ground). This is normally done by connecting a 2 or 3
wire cable between an APM Input and one of the output channels on the RC
radio.</p>
<p>If you are using any servos such as are required with a traditional
helicopter or a camera gimbal, you will need to provide an additional
dedicated power supply for the servos. The APM is intended to
<strong>control</strong> servos, not power them.</p>
<p>The following sections describe the APM power circuit (you will need to
understand this in order to design a power supply for your APM, or
provide additional power), and your options for powering the APM and
connected components.</p>
</section>
<section id="apm-power-circuit">
<h2>APM power circuit<a class="headerlink" href="#apm-power-circuit" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="../_images/POwerRails.jpg"><img alt="../_images/POwerRails.jpg" src="../_images/POwerRails.jpg" /></a>
<p>There are two “sides” to the positive circuit in the board. Each side
has positive-rails available for inputing power or distributing it to
peripheral devices. The center row of pins in the three groups of pins
(Outputs, Inputs, Analog) labeled “+” are referred to as a
“positive-rail”. This means that the base of all the + pins are
connected so they represent a single electrical path. The positive-rails
of the Input and Analog group are connected together. So we have two
separate positive circuits, one in the Outputs and the other made up of
the Input/Analog.</p>
<p>All of the components on the board take power from various points on
these rails, so it is necessary for both “sides” to be receiving +5V
(within the specs below) for the board to function.</p>
<p>These positive-rails can be joined together by placing JP1 in its
position on the board. This connects all the positive-rails ands
provides power to both sides of the board, so that low-level power can
be distributed to peripheral sensors and devices: 3DR Radios, sonar, RC
Rx, etc. via the power-rails.</p>
<p>When using the power module, the circuit path is as follows:</p>
<p>From the power module connection the negative wire is connected to a
negative-rail shared by the entire board regardless of JP1.</p>
<p>Positive voltage comes in to a T-junction. to the left is a path through
the JP1 to the positive-rail of the Outputs. To the right it flows
through an over-voltage, over-current, reverse-polarity protection(500mA
fuse and 6V Zener diode). A side effect of passing through the Zener
diode is a .37V loss, therefore input voltage should be bumped up by
.37V to account for this. From here the positive voltage runs to the
positive-rails of the Inputs and Analog. Inputs should not be used to
power anything except your RC receiver.</p>
<p>Higher current loads such as servos should be powered from the
power-rails (positive-negative) of the Output side. You must use an
adequate voltage-regulator to provide power directly to the Output
power-rails, all servo power leads will attach to these same rails (the
signal wires can connect on the Analog “S” pins in the case of a camera
gimbal). Since JP1 is removed in this scenario, the other “side” of the
board will need power provided to its power-rails directly.</p>

<h2>Non-technical description of the power supply requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#non-technical-description-of-the-power-supply-requirements" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The description below simply supplements and provides an alternate view
of the information above.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The APM 2.5/2.6 board has two separate power circuits which make it
very easy to power by a variety of methods.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>A fused power circuit provides primary board and general I/O
power: (It cannot provide power for servos).</p></li>
<li><p>The Other power circuit is for the OUTPUT connector power rail:
(it can provide power for servos).</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>The jumper JP 1 determines whether the two power circuits are
connected or separate.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>If JP1 is removed, the power rail on the OUTPUT connector “Floats”
and may be used to distribute power.</p></li>
<li><p>Although if JP1 is removed the OUTPUT connector cannot be used to
supply power to the APM board.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>It is possible to power the APM board from the Power Module connector
or the OUTPUT or INPUT connectors.</p></li>
<li><p>Normally the APM 2.5/2.6 “Power Module” is used to provide primary
APM 2.5 board and general I/O power.</p></li>
<li><p>Alternatively primary board power can be supplied by a BEC either
from one of the ESCs or from an external BEC.</p></li>
<li><p>If servos are used, supplementary power is required.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Generally one power supply is provided for the board and one or
more additional power supplies for the servos.</p></li>
<li><p>But if a sufficiently large external BEC is used it can supply
power for both via the OUTPUT connector.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Only the OUTPUT connector can provide power for servos as the other
circuit is fused.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The address connector is sometimes used provide servo signals, but
the servos power must come from elsewhere.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>How you are powering your APM board and or servos determines whether
JP1 is  installed or not.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>(Whether the two power circuits are separated or connected).</p></li>
<li><p>All possible configurations are detailed Below.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>The type of use will determine which options are available.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Copter can power the APM from a power module or a UBEC or a BEC
from one of the ESCs and can power servos from a UBEC or from the
other ESC’s BECs.</p></li>
<li><p>Plane can power the APM from the power module,  the BEC from the
flight motors ESC or a  separate UBEC and can power servos from a
separate UBEC or the flight motors BEC if it is large enough.</p></li>
<li><p>Rover  can power the APM from the power module,  the BEC from the
drive motor’s ESC or a  separate UBEC and can power the steering
servo from a separate UBEC or the drive motors BEC if it is large
enough.</p></li>

<p>On the bench, you’ll probably be powering the board via your USB cable
while you set it up and test it. But in your aircraft, you’ll need to
power it with your on board power system, which is usually your LiPo
battery going through an ESC or the Power Module. In the case of a
multicopter, this can come through your Power Distribution Board (PDB),
which will break out the 5V output from the one of the electronic speed
controls (ESCs) or the Power module which is wored directly to the
battery.</p>
<p>In the picture below, the red and black wires are the 5b    m hV power
cable coming from a PDB. You can plug them into any two pins along the
5V and Ground (middle and outer) rows of pins on APM 2.5’s Output side.
The other cable, which in this case is a four-wire cable with orange and
white wires for a quadcopter, is the signal cable to the PDB, which are
the wires that APM 2.5 will use to command each of the ESCs.</p>
<p>The picture below is of APM 2; but the concept is applicable to APM 2.5.</p>

<p>It’s also possible to power APM 2.5 from two separate sources, one
powering the RC system on the input side, and the other powering the
output side (servos or ESCs). This is determined by a jumper on the JP1
pins (see below). If the jumper is on, which is the factory default, the
board is powered from the OUTPUT rail or the USB. If the jumper is off,
the board is powered from the INPUT rail, but the OUTPUT rail will need
its own power source. This configuration is used if you want to have two
separate power sources in your aircraft, one powering the servos and the
other powering the electronics. The ideal input voltage is 5.37v +/-0.0v
and may not be provided by a typical ESC.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>Do not exceed Abs MAX input voltages when connecting power
supply or you will damage your board.</p>
</div>
<p>In some cases it may be a good idea to set the input voltage slightly
above the median (but below the maximum) to account for possible voltage
drops during momentary high current events.</p>
<p>The APM2.5 by itself draws relatively little current (200ma range) and a
power source capable of providing 300 - 500ma will provide plenty of
margin. However, if servos or other power consuming devices are being
driven by the same power source you must consider the power requirements
for those devices as well and provide plenty of margin to prevent
disastrous “brown-outs”. For instance, a single digital servo can easily
draw 1-5 amps depending on its size and performance. (Note: ESCs do not
consume power from the APM) If you experience spurious resets or other
odd behavior it is most likely due to noisy or insufficient power to the
APM. As with all logic boards, electrical noise from the motors, servos,
or other high current devices on the power source can cause
unpredictable behavior.</p>
<p>It is recommend that a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dpcav.com/xcart/Power-Supply-Filter-L-C-Type.html">power filter</a> be
used in such conditions.</p>
<p>Too short or long power wires, bad or old connectors, or insufficient
current capability of the APM power source can result in a “brown-out”
situation resulting in unpredictable operation. This is particularly
true in traditional helicopters where the collective servos can draw
3-20 amps in short bursts. The power source must be able to accommodate
this without voltage droop or voltage spikes. A quality switching type
BEC (e.g one of
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.castlecreations.com/products-search?qs=bec">these</a> or one of
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.western-robotics.com/WRL-HBECM2">these</a>) can be a
solution depending on overall current requirements. Many of these type
of regulators are programmable so remember to program them with in the
safe operating range of the APM2. Linear voltage regulators are not
recommended as they are inefficient and prone to overheating and heat
induced failures. APM2 should never be connected directly to a battery
of any type.</p>
<p>Power source problems are common and can be insidious and frustrating.
Be meticulous. Any autopilot or autopilot is useless and
potentially dangerous without good clean power source.</p>
