.</p></li>
<li><p>Dec 16, 2011: Copter 2.1 released. This is the first version that
supports both the APM 1 and APM 2 boards. If you’re building it with
Arduino, you’ll need the “relaxpatch” version of Arduino. To
harmonize with APM 2, the hardware CLI switch is no longer used–you
now get into the CLI by hitting “Enter” three times in a terminal.
Other details are in the announcement post
<a class="reference external" href="https://diydrones.com/forum/topics/arducopter-2-0-56">here</a> .</p></li>
<li><p>Dec 3, 2011: Copter 2.0.55 released. Most stable flying version yet.
Includes new stability patch by default and a new DCM gain and clamp
value that should reduce drift due to linear acceleration in missions
or long flights. Switched rate gain calculation to use raw IMU rather
than the DCM’s omega. This crisps up the response a lot. 1280 has
lost local flash logging, sorry, but it’s just not supportable any
longer. Some older tests have returned now the program memory is
freed. Remember, to use the new logging format on the 2560, you need
to erase it at least once to format it.</p></li>
<li><p>Nov 30, 2011: Copter 2.0.54 released. Bug fixes, better alt hold, CH7
switch to Simple Mode enabled.</p></li>
<li><p>Nov 19, 2011: Copter 2.0.50 released. Many bug fixes and performance
enhancements. Log files will now overwrite from the beginning when
the dataflash is full (rather than stopping). Initial compatibility
with MAVLink 1.0. A full list of changes is
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.diydrones.com/forum/topics/arducopter-2-0-50">here</a> .</p></li>
<li><p>Oct 16, 2011: Copter 2.0.49 released. Tweaked Alt Hold PIDs, Loiter
PIDs based on SIM testing and feedback. Increased distance error for
loiter for faster return to center. Params for camera roll gain
fixed.</p></li>
<li><p>Oct 14, 2011: Copter 2.0.48 released. The PWM output has been set to
400hz (to counter the low pass filter in most Turnigy PWMs). The
DCM’s Roll and Pitch gains were lowered to .03 (recommendation of
Hein Hollander). MAVLink has gotten a re-work for performance and
memory savings.</p></li>
<li><p>Oct 7, 2011: Copter 2.0.47 released. Fixed RTL overshooting bug.
Better loiter PIDs</p></li>
<li><p>Oct 2, 2011: Copter 2.0.46 released. Rolls up all changes since
2.0.42, including improved sensor filtering, loiter and waypoint
navigation. Simple mode has been changed and Guided mode added <a class="reference external" href="https://diydrones.com/forum/topics/arducopter-2-0-43">(see
this post for more
information).</a></p></li>
<li><p>Sept 11, 2011: Copter 2.0.42 released. Includes much more efficient
DCM processing, now running 25% faster. Should be most stable yet.
Also includes improved Circle mode.</p></li>
<li><p>Sept 7, 2011: Copter 2.0.40 released. Totally new control laws, which
are much more effective. Loiter should now stay within a 1m box and
RTL is rock solid. New Alt Hold mixes the temperature sensor reading
with the barometric pressure sensor readings for drift-free results.
New flight modes, including user configurable ones. This is a release
candidate for the first non-beta code.</p></li>
<li><p>August 23, 2011: Copter 2.0.39b released. Many bug fixes and some
experimental new control laws. This release is mostly for beta
testing feedback to prepare for 2.0.40, which is a non-beta release
candidate.</p></li>
<li><p>July 30, 2011: Copter Beta 2.0.38 released. Lots of changes, big and
small. Moved ground start to first arming. Added ground start flag.
Moved throttle_integrator to 50hz loop. CAMERA_STABILIZER
deprecated - now always on. Renamed current logging bit mask to match
APM. Added MA filter to PID - D term. Adjusted PIDs based on
continued testing and new PID filter. Added MASK_LOG_SET_DEFAULTS
to match APM. Moved some stuff out of ground start into system start
where it belonged. Added slower Yaw gains for DCM when the copter is
in the air. Changed camera output to be none scaled PWM. Fixed bug
where ground_temperature was unfiltered. Shortened Baro startup
time. Fixed issue with Nav_WP integrator not being reset. RTL no
longer yaws towards home. Circle mode for flying a 10m circle around
the point where it was engaged (not tested at all! Consider it
experimental).</p></li>
<li><p>July 17, 2011: Copter Beta 2.0.37 released. Added rate of change
limit for noisy Sonars. Code converted to static functions to save
memory.</p></li>
<li><p>July 16, 2011: AC Beta 2.0.36 released. Added Yaw control when
descending in Alt hold, lowered kP &amp; kD for Alt hold a tad, Adjusted
RTL behavior to do speed control up to 4m to home, then go into
Loiter. Fixed issue with AUTO not getting proper input.</p></li>
<li><p>July 12, 2011: AC Beta 2.0.35 released. Added camera reversing
parameters in AP_Var, Added RTL Throttle Hold set/check, Added
dynamic speed control to slow down as you reach waypoints and RTL
Home, upped Yaw Dead zone slightly. Available as a hex firmware
download in the Mission Planner.</p></li>
<li><p>July 9, 2011: AC Beta 2.0.34 preview released. Lots of new control
laws and needs more testing before we give this wide release. Right
now it’s download only (get the file from the download section above
and compile and load with Arduino). Full description of the changes
in this release is
<a class="reference external" href="https://diydrones.com/forum/topics/arducopter-2034-preview">here.</a></p></li>
<li><p>July 2, 2011: AC Beta 2.0.32 released: New Loiter PIDs, tuned down
control on standard frame, shunk the mixing range for sonar from 3
meters to 2 meters, added framework for Guided mode - not tested!
removed pitch and roll deadzone, decoupled S, MPLE mode from LOITER
PIDs Synced MAVLink with APM, Logs report correct WP number now.
Disabled Sonar spike filter.</p></li>
<li><p>June 29, 2011: AC Beta 2.0.30 released. Minor bug fixes. Note that
there is a known issue with the magnetometer, due to a change in the
sensor used in recent DIY Drones magnetometer boards. The code to
autodetect which one you have is still a big wonky and compass
readings my be off by a factor of 2. We’ll fix that in the next
update.</p></li>
<li><p>June 27, 2011: AC Beta 2.0.28 released. Fixed serious bug (exit from
!Alt_Hold left quad with controls reversed) in 2.0.26, and other
tweaks. All users should upgrade immediately.</p></li>
<li><p>June 24, 2011: AC2 Beta 2.0.26 released: Minor updates. Arming motors
now for only Stabilize, Simple, and Acro Modes. V Octo Support.</p></li>
<li><p>June 19, 2011: AC2 Beta 2.0.25 released. This brings Copter
(traditional heli) into the AC2 trunk, giving it full MAVLink
capability, too. Many other tweaks and performance improvements
(details
<a class="reference external" href="https://diydrones.com/forum/topics/arducopter-2024b">here</a> ).
Getting close now!</p></li>
<li><p>June 5, 2011: Much improved Mission Planner 1.0 released. Check out
the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.diydrones.com/profiles/blogs/new-apm-planner-10">gorgeous new design!</a></p></li>
<li><p>June 3, 2011: <a class="reference external" href="https://diydrones.com/forum/topics/arducopter-2023">AC2 Beta 2.0.23 released.</a>
Minor bug fixes and tuning to improve loiter and hex airframe
performance. Sonar test added to CLI test suite.</p></li>
<li><p>May 27, 2011: AC2 Beta 2.0.16
<a class="reference external" href="https://diydrones.com/forum/topics/705844:Topic:393643">released</a>
. Improvements in yaw control, minor changes in LED function, and
other bug fixes. The Mission Planner has also been updated, so check
the Update menu item in that to upgrade. Just a few more things left
to get beta test feedback on before we’ll feel confident in taking
AC2 out of beta.</p></li>
<li><p>May 18, 2011: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.diydrones.com/profiles/blogs/ac2-206-beta">AC2 beta 2.0.6</a>
released. We’re still bug-fixing at a rapid pace, so thanks for your
patience. The Mission Planner has been significantly revamped,
especially on the firmware upload process, which is now based on
visual icons. Frame choices are now made at firmware upload time, but
orientation (x vs +) can be made in the CLI. We still recommend that
new users stick with the <a class="reference external" href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/ardupirates/wikis/Softwares_Building.wiki">ArduPirates code</a>
, but people with well-tested hardware are invited to join the AC2
beta test. Feedback at DIY Drones, please.</p></li>
<li><p>May 14, 2011: AC2 beta is improving quickly, thanks to the huge
increase in feedback and testing from the open beta release. The
latest tested version can always be downloaded from the Mission
Planner. At this point, we feel that it is stable enough for most
users with well-tested hardware, although please remember it’s still
in beta so there may still be some bugs and you’re flying at your own
risk. Go through the setup process carefully and please read the
manual before flying!</p></li>
<li><p>May 7, 2011: Copter 2 first beta released. Details
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.diydrones.com/profiles/blogs/arducopter-20-beta-first">here</a>
. This is an early public beta and may be unstable. Some features and
portions of the manual are a work in progress and will be changed
over the next few weeks. Most users are advised to continue using
<a class="reference external" href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/ardupirates/wikis/Softwares_Building.wiki">ArduPirates code</a>
until Copter 2 comes out of beta.</p></li>
<li><p>May 5, 2011: Manual revised for Copter 2. Older Copter 1 manual
unavailable (was on old google.code site).</p></li>
